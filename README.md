# COVID-19 Data Exploration

This project explores global trends in COVID-19 cases and deaths from **January 1, 2020 to April 30, 2021**, using data collected from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths). I analyzed the dataset to uncover regional patterns over time and visualized key insights in an interactive Tableau dashboard.
